Tailwind Elements **is a a plugin** that extends the functionality of the library with many interactive components.

In some dynamic components (like dropdowns or modals) we add Font Awesome icons and custom JavaScript. However, they do not require any additional installation, all the necessary code is always included in the example and copied to any Tailwind project - it will work.

## Quick Start tutorial

};
```

    `<script src="../path/to/tw-elements/dist/js/index.min.js"></script>`

If you use Webpack or other bundlers you can also import it like this:\
`import 'tw-elements';`
